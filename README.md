# BellMan-Ford-
 Summary: 
 This program implement BellMan-Ford algorithm as described in the text book in Section 24.1 CLRS.   
 Input from text file is passed as command line agruments.The input-file contain adjacency list, contin Vertex, 
 adjacent edges and weight. An edge will be a tuple consisting of the adjacent vertex and the edge weight. 
 You may assume that vertices will be represented by single alphabetic characters and that edge weights will be integers. 
 Each entry should be separated by a semicolon.  
 -----> Output:shortest distance from a single a source       
 1.console: Intermidate steps to show implimentation Bellman-Ford algorithm in full and filnal result of the shortest_path 
 will be dispalayed.    
 
 How compile/run prgrm:    
 1. g++ BellmanFord.cpp  
 2. ./a.out < input.txt
